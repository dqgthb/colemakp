Colemak for Programmers

* Currently only available for Windows programmers



## Motivation

This is invented to solve the notorious shift key problem: https://wiki.c2.com/?ShiftKeyProblem

## Changed Keys (from -> to)

Programmers do not need to press shift key anymore for special characters.
```
\`1234567890 -> ~!@#$%^&*()
``` 

Instead, programmers need to press shift key for numbers, unfortunately. It is not too bad if you try.
```
~!@#$%^&*() -> \`1234567890
```

### For c-like languages, curly braces are annoying. 
```
{} -> []
[] -> {}
```
